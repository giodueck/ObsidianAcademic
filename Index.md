Note-taking for University and learning in general should be concept based, not sequential. Sequential note-taking relies on the teacher laying out information in the best manner, which is not always the case.

Also, sequential note-taking leaves no space for later improvement or revisions, and I never look at those notes again. Obsidian can help solve this issue.
