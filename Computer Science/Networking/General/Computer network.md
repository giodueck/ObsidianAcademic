# Computer network
A set of interconnected computing devices which can exchange information using a [[Protocol]].

Networks evolved to solve the problem of sharing resources within organizations, e.g. a shared printer, and to overcome the limitations of physical media like floppy discs.

### Two general types:
- [[LAN]]: Local Area Network
- [[WAN]]: Wide Area Network

### Advantages:
- Resource sharing
- Information access
- High reliability
- Good cost/performance ratio

### Elements
- Physical medium (i.e. wiring)
- Adapters to said medium
- [[Protocol|Protocols]] for sending and receiving information
- Error checking
- Resource administration
- Additional services for information
- Additional software, security, etc.

### Reference model
[[OSI]]
