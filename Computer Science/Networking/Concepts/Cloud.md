# Cloud
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, primarily [[#Storage]] but also computing power, not directly managed by the user.

Large clouds are often distributed over several locations.

## Storage
Cloud storage is a model of computer data storage in logical pools inside a network, which are collectively "the cloud". Typically, the physical media and network infrastructure are managed by a hosting company.
