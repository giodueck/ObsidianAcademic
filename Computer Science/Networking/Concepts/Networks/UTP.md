# Unshielded Twisted Pair
Common type of wiring used for network connections. Two conductors for a single circuit are twisted together to improve electromagnetic compatibility, that is it reduces EM radiation and crosstalk from neighboring pairs.

## Categories
Several common categories exist, each with different [[Bandwidth|bandwidth]]

| Name | Bandwith | Speed   | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ----- |
| 5e   | 100MHz   | Gigabit | Most common for LANs, limited to 100m |
| 6    | 250 MHz  | Gigabit | Same speed as 5e but supports PoE, limited to 55m |
| 6A   | 500 MHz  | 10Gb    | Limited to 100m |
