# Structured cabling
Set of cables, connectors, designs and installation techniques that provide services to any type of local data, voice, or other networks, without the need to resort to any single provider of services and devices.

Consists of many smaller standardized subsystems, hence structured.

## Origins
Buildings and campuses were originally not built with communications infrastructure in mind. Structured cabling came about to fix this issue, and to standardize these systems.

## Objectives
- Cover the needs of end-users during its life-time (10 years)
- Integrate different sercives that depend on cable routing
- Increase network performance

Needs to be...
- Application independent
- Documented
- Long-term projected (>10 years)

## Benefits
- Less errors -> better performance
- Integration of elements from different providers
- Simpler administration and management of networks

## Standards
Several standards exist to define the structure of these systems, these include 
- [[ANSI]]
- [[TIA]]
- [[EIA]]
among others.

## Components
1. *Building connections (Entrance facilities)* is where the telephone company or ISP ends and connects to the customer's network, which begin here.
2. *Equipment rooms* house equipment and wiring consolidation points that serve the users in the building or campus.
3. *Backbone cabling* (vertical) is the interconnections and intraconnections in and between facilities' telecoms rooms and equipment rooms.
4. *Telecommunications rooms* ([[Rack|racks]]) connect backbone cabling with horizontal cabling.
5. *Horizontal cabling* standard cabling inside a facility that connects telecoms rooms to individual outlets in work areas. Usually the cabling is [[UTP]].
6. *Work-area* components connect end-users to horizontal cabling.
