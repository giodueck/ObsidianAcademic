programs were launched by India in 1979, France in 1982 and the EU in 1986. (3)

## Applications

Weather, oceanography, agriculture and fishing, biodiversity, forestry, landscape. (1) (5)

## Data characteristics

- Spatial resolution: the size of a pixel recorded in a raster image
- Spectral resolution: the wavelength of the frequency bands recorded
- Radiometric resolution: the number of intensities of radiation the sensor is able to distinguish
- Temporal resolution: the frequency of flyovers, relevant only in time-series
