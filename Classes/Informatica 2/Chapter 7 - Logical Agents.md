# Chapter 7 - Logical Agents

## Knowledge bases
*Knowledge base*: set of sentences in a formal language. Domain-specific knowledge.
*Inference engine*: Domain-independent algorithms.

Declarative approach to building an agentL *tell* it what it needs to know.
Then it can *ask* itself what to do, answers should follow from KB.

Agents can be viewed at the knowledge level:
- *what they know*

Or at the implementation level:
- which data structures are used, which algorithms are used
