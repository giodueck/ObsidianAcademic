# SLR - Introduccion

## Introduccion
What is a SLR?
- A means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question or phenomenon of interest.
- SLRs aim to present a fair *evaluation of a research topic* by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology.

Why a SLR?
- Most research starts or should start with a literature review of some sort.
- A systematic review *synthesizes existing work* in a manner that is fair and seems to be fair.

How to do a SLR?
- SLRs must be undertaken in accordance with a predefined *search strategy*, that must allow the completeness of the search to be assessed.
- Researchers performing a SLR must make every effort to *identify and report research that does not support their preferred research hypothesis* as well as identifying and reporting research that supports it.

What is a SLR for?
- *To summarize* the existing evidence concerning a treatment or technology.
- *To identify* any gaps in current research in order to suggest areas for further investigation.
- *To provide a framework/background* in order to appropriately position new research activities.
- *To examine* the extent to which empirical evidence supports/contradicts theoretical hypotheses, or assist in the generation of new hypotheses.

Pros
- The *well-defined methodology* makes it less likely that the results of the literature are biased.
- They can *provide information about the effects* of some phenomenon across a wide range of settings and empirical methods.
- In the case of quantitative studies, *it is possible to combine data* using meta-analytic techniques.

Cons
- The major disadvantage of SLRs is that they require *significantly more effort* than other methods.

## Systematic Mapping Study
- When there is likely *very little evidence* or very broad evidence it is likely better to do a SMS instead.
- Allows the existing evidence to be plotted with a *high level of granularity*
- Allows the identification of evidence *clusters* and evidence *deserts* to direct the focus of future systematic reviews and identify areas to study further.

## Review process
### Planning
#### Identification of the need for a review
- Researchers should *identify and review* any existing systematic reviews of the phenomenon of interest against appropriate evaluation criteria.

#### Research questions specification
- Specifying the research questions is the most important part of any systematic review.
- The *review questions drive* the entire review methodology:
	- The *search process* must identify primary studies that address the research questions.
	- The *data extraction* process must extract the data items needed to answer the questions.
	- The *data analysis* process must synthesize the data in such a way that the questions can be answered.
- The *critical issue* in any systematic review is to ask the right question.
- The *right question* is usually one that:
	- Is *meaningful and important* to practitioners as well as to researchers
	- Will lead to *changes* in the field or increase confidence in current methods
- Question types:
	- *Assessing the effect* of a technology
	- *Assessing the frequency* or rate of development or adoption of technology
	- *Identifying cost and risk* associated with the use of a technology or methodology
	- *Associating the impact* of some technology or methodology

#### Review Protocol development
- Specifies the methods that will be used to undertake a specific systematic review, to reduce researcher bias
- Review protocol development
	- *Background* or the rationale of the survey
	- The *research questions* that the review is intended to answer
	- The *search strategy* that will be used to search for primary studies including search terms and resources to be searched. Resources include digital libraries, journals, etc.
	- *Study selection criteria*. Study selection criteria are used to determine which studies are included in, or excluded from, a systematic review. It is usually helpful to pilot the selection criteria on a subset of primary studies.
	- *Study selection procedures*. The protocol should describe how the selection criteria will be applied. E.g. how many assessors will evaluate each prospective primary study and how disagreements will be resolved.
	- *Study quality assessment checklists* and procedures. The researchers should develop quality checklists to assess the individual studies. The purpose of the quality assessment will guide the development of checklists.
	- *Data extraction strategy*. This defines how the information required from each primary study will be obtained.
	- *Synthesis of the extracted data*. This defines the synthesis strategy. This should clarify whether or not a formal meta-analysis is intended and if so what techniques are used.
	- *Dissemination strategy*. It is important to communicate the results effectively. Could be through journals, conferences, web sites, etc.
	- *Project timetable*

##### Review protocol
Search strategies are usually iterative and benefit from:
- Preliminary searches aimed at identifying existing systematic reviews and assessing the volume of useful studies
- Trial searches of various terms

Initial searches for primary studies can initially use electronic databases but this is not enough.

Other sources must be searched, sometimes manually, including:
- Reference lists from relevant primary studies and review articles
- Journals and conference proceedings
- Research registers
- Internet

It is fundamental to identify expert researchers.

###### Search string
Constructed using these steps:
- Define the major terms
- Identify alternative spellings, synonyms, related terms for major terms
- Check the keywords in any relevant papers we already had
- Use the boolean OR to incorporate alternative spellings, synonyms and related terms
- Use the boolean AND to like the major terms

##### Study selection criteria
- Should be decided during protocol definition
- Inclusion and exclusion criteria should be based of the research question

Primary studies selection procedures:
- Study selection process
	- Initially interpreted liberally, so that unless studies can be clearly excluded based on titles, copies should be obtained

##### Data extraction strategy
Data extraction forms must contain, at least
- Name of review
- Date of data extraction
- Title, authors, journal, publication details
- Space for additional notes

## Lessons learned
- The poor quality of search engines available (precision, available fields) made them hard to work with
- Researchers should familiarize themselves with the available tools.
